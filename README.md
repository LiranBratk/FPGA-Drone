# Drone Controller Project

This project was developed as part of my finals. It involves designing and building an (almost) self-balancing drone controller using **FPGA** and **ESP32**. The system integrates PWM signal generation and 3D-printed components to create a functional drone.

## Key Features
- **FPGA DE0 Nano SoC**: Manages motor speed and balance.
- **ESP32 Communication**: Provides wireless control through a web interface.
- **3D-Printed Design**: Custom chassis and components printed for optimal performance.

## Development Tools
- Programming: **VHDL**, **C** and **C++**
- Simulation: **Quartus Prime**, **ModelSim**
- Hardware: **FPGA DE0 Nano SoC**, **Arduino Uno**

Although the primary project book is in Hebrew, feel free to explore the source code and designs included in this repository.
